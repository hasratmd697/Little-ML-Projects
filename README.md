## 🎯 About The Project

This repository is a compilation of my work in the field of machine learning. Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook or Python script with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations. The projects are designed to solve real-world problems like predicting house prices, classifying customer churn, and segmenting customers.

### Key Technologies Used:
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Algorithms Implemented

This repository features projects built using a variety of powerful machine learning algorithms:

* **Regression Models:**
    * **Linear Regression:** For predicting continuous values based on linear relationships.
    * **Lasso Regression:** A regularization technique used to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting.
    * **Random Forest Regressor:** An ensemble method for high-accuracy regression tasks.

* **Classification Models:**
    * **Logistic Regression:** A fundamental algorithm for binary classification problems.
    * **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier:** A powerful classifier that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data points.
    * **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble of decision trees used for robust classification.
    * **XGBoost:** A gradient-boosting framework known for its high performance and speed.

* **Clustering Models:**
    * **K-Means Clustering:** An unsupervised algorithm for partitioning data into K distinct clusters.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system.
* **Python:** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip:** Comes with Python installation.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages**
    
    It is recommended to create a virtual environment first.
    ```sh
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Then, install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project environment.)*

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Now you can open and run the notebooks for each project!
